# It is time for a new project
When I am out with my RV I need to make sure the RV is safe to drive before I leave the 
camp site. I need to close all cabinets, remove things from the table and bench. Pull 
in the step etc. There is a checklist that needs to be repeated. Have not found
a tool that supports this. So I will create it.
